            knowledge and skills
        -> purpose: to teach how to create, manage, query, and maintain relational databases in real-world scenarios
        -> relevance: learning MySQL provides foundational skills applicable to nearly all modern relational database
            systems and widely used in software development, data analysis, and web applications
        -> learning approach: course is structured as guided lessons, exercises, and reference material that can be
            revisited for reinforcement
    -> learning time
        -> basics: a complete beginner can grasp the fundamentals of SQL queries, table creation, and database design
            within one week
        -> proficiency: becoming comfortable with SQL, writing efficient queries, and managing relational databases
            requires regular practice and problem-solving
        -> continuous learning: students are encouraged to refer back to course materials, reattempt exercises, and
            experiment with queries on their own databases
    -> prerequisites
        -> computer with internet access capable of running MySQL and MySQL Workbench
        -> free MySQL account for practising SQL commands in a real environment
        -> basic knowledge of the command line interface (CLI) is helpful for running scripts and navigating
            directories but not mandatory
        -> no prior programming experience is required, the course is suitable for complete beginners
        -> the course is designed to provide step-by-step guidance and practical exercises to build confidence
            with SQL and database concepts
    -> what you will learn in this course
        -> database design
            -> understanding the structure of relational databases including tables, columns, primary keys, and
                foreign keys
            -> designing new relational database systems from scratch including planning tables, relationships,
                and constraints
            -> normalisation principles: avoiding data redundancy and ensuring data integrity
        -> database interpretation
            -> reading and analysing existing databases to understand complex schemas and relationships between tables
            -> identifying keys, indexes, constraints, and data types to make informed queries and modifications
            -> understanding relational diagrams and how entities relate in multi-table databases
        -> data management
            -> creating, updating, and deleting records efficiently using SQL commands
            -> backing up databases and restoring them to prevent data loss
            -> ensuring data integrity and consistency during updates and deletions
            -> managing large datasets through optimisation and indexing strategies
        -> SQL proficiency
            -> using structured query language (SQL) to retrieve, manipulate, and aggregate data
            -> core queries: insert, update, select, delete, truncate, and merge operations
            -> joins: inner join, left join, right join, self join, and cross join to combine data from multiple tables
            -> data aggregation: group by, order by, having, sum, count, avg, min, max
            -> filtering and limiting results using where clauses, limit, and conditional operators
            -> exporting and importing data for reporting, backups, and migration between systems
            -> advanced SQL concepts including subqueries, nested queries, and conditional logic
    -> course structure
        -> guided lessons: step-by-step walkthroughs of SQL fundamentals, database creation, and query execution
        -> reference material: a complete resource to revisit for practice, revision, and problem-solving
        -> learning resources: tutorials, instructional videos, assignments, quizzes, and real-world exercises to
            reinforce learning
        -> practical exercises: encourages experimentation with queries, database design, and troubleshooting common
            issues
        -> flexibility: beginners should follow the course from the start, experienced learners can jump to specific
            topics for review or skill refresh
    -> why learn SQL & MySQL
        -> essential skill: SQL is language-agnostic and widely used in Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and many other
            programming environments
        -> job market relevance: SQL consistently ranks among the top skills for programming, data analysis, web
            development, and backend development roles in the UK and globally
        -> practicality: mastering SQL allows you to interact with databases, analyse large datasets, automate
            reporting, and support business intelligence tasks
        -> career advantage: provides a foundation for learning advanced database technologies, data engineering, and
            data science
    -> summary
        -> by completing this course, students will:
            -> install, design, create, and query relational databases efficiently using SQL and MySQL Workbench
            -> understand relational database structures, normalisation, keys, constraints, and indexes
            -> write complex queries to extract, filter, aggregate, and manipulate data
            -> manage, backup, and restore databases to ensure data integrity and reliability
            -> develop problem-solving skills in real-world database management scenarios
