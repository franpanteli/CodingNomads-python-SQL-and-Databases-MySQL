""" Using MySQL Workbench Video Notes
    -> outline
        -> using MySQL Workbrench
        -> we are using the Sakila DB database
        -> we don't have to have the Sakila database installed before watching the video
            -> he does examples on this database in this video
        -> we install the database in upcoming sessions (not this one)
    -> SQL is for querying the database
    -> MySQL is an application for RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
        -> this runs in the terminal
        -> MySQL Workbench is the same thing, but with a GUI
        -> we previously installed this
        -> this required making a connection to a local host
