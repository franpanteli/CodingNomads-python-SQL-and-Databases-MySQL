        -> summary: what is a database
    -> introduction
        -> DATABASES ARE FOR THE CONTENTS OF WEBPAGES

            -> common uses for databases
            -> types of databases
            -> the most popular databases <- MongoDB is part of this
    -> definition of a database
        -> a system for organising structured information (data)
            -> rows / columns, like a spreadsheet
            -> this can be done electronically
                -> we can search / store / analyse and modify data, using a computer system
    -> what you can do with a database
        -> managing data <- large amounts of data in a structured system
        -> accurately store data, for it's integrity
        -> safely store data long-term
            -> data only stored by the application could be lost if it shuts down
            -> third-party storage
        -> ACCESSING DATA CONCURRENTLY <- MULTIPLE USERS CAN ACCESS THE SAME DATA
